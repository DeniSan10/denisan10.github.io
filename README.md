Log 32: Transcendence through Dismemberment

-02/08/1789-

First subject inflicted with Lunaris, fully restrained. His eyes, locked onto mine, devoid of emotion, bloodshot, vacant.. nothing human left in them. I begin the procedure. The skin’s resistant, but I make deep cuts. No reaction. I tear into the flesh beneath, still no sign of life. Then, I rip the limb off. Movement now, uncontrollable, and blood spills. This isn’t ordinary blood, which was originally labelled "Lunaris". It glows, pulses with a strange energy, as if alive. We need more. The man’s aggressively tried to reach me as I drain his Lunaris more and more. His eyes bulge and blood pours out as tears, his screams grow weaker until there’s nothing left but a lifeless shell. His once-glowing eyes are dull, his teeth falling out, and his veins no longer pulsate. He is nothing now, just a hollow form that once lived a normal life. Pathetic.

Two hours pass, and the second subject, now injected with a sample of Lunaris, starts showing the same signs as the first, his skin becomes unnaturally pale, almost translucent. His veins, once a healthy blue, turn into dark red rivers beneath his skin. His eyes start to bleed out as his screams fill the room. A cold sweat forms on his body as the transformation deepens and screams. The Lunaris is doing its work.
