                    backgrounds, enigmatic compositions, and striking visuals, perfectly capturing the essence of
                    despair and the haunting post-apocalyptic atmosphere... where delusion is the last thing left to

But here's the kicker: he absolutely hates the taste of humans, so don't let his name fool you! He's just a little more picky than you'd think.">
