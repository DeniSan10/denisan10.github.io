                                treatments
                                for the zombie serum as a bioengineer. However, her skills go far beyond the lab.</p>
                            <p>
                                Trained from childhood by her father, a decorated police chief, Paula honed
                                her skills to become a fearless and precise fighter, both long range and short range.
                                Her father’s dedication also
                                inspired Gabriel, driving him to embrace the path of a brave exterminator.

                        and Gabriel placed in the Horned-Owls Sector, each grouped by gender. As a result, they are
                        unable to make contact during the ongoing chaos. Paula is sent on campus trips with her team,
                        treating people worldwide, while also facing waves of undead attacks everywhere.

                        Though separated by distance and surrounded by horrors, they keep in touch every day, yearning

                            <p>As the founder of the Saint Mary's Task Force, his mission is to break the millennia-old
                                curse of the Lunarium. A mysterious figure with a tragic past, his story began on the
                                curse’s first day.</p>
                            <p>That day, he faced an undead man— the beggining of everything. The creature attacked
                                mercilessly, but he fought back with desperate strength, dismembering it at great cost.

                                The battle, however, left him disfigured and infected, his face unrecognisable. Rejected
                                by society,
                                he hid behind masks and shadows. Refusing to despair, he used his brilliant mind to
                                found an organisation to uncover the curse’s truth.</p>

                        result, he takes a defensive approach. Will this work against him? Not at all.

                        All members of the corporation, alongside the government, admire and respect him for his
                        contributions to the world. He stands as the last beacon of hope, relentlessly fighting to

                                However, when he lost everything he loved, his mind turned destructive. He confronted
                                Cadaver-7, but lost the battle and was forced to become something against his own will.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As a mockery of his former self, his corpse was used as a basis to construct a machine,
                                his blood
                                infused with the cursed serum. Now, this man is destined to spread cruelty across the
                                globe,
                                furthering Cadaver-7's reign, with not a trace of emotion behind his cold, metallic
                                eyes.

                                Foe or ally? Hamza is a character who somewhat shaped the curse, but not intentionally.
                                He may seem like a bad man, but he genuinely isn’t. He acts out of a deep desire to
                                protect, having grown up in harsh, unforgiving conditions alongside his five younger
                                brothers.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The constant struggle for survival in such an environment has hardened him,
                                shaping a tough exterior that hides his true intentions.

                                embodiment of evil... The mastermind behind the disaster. He shows no remorse, if he even
                                possesses a soul capable of feeling. He is pure hatred and rage, all fused into one
                                sinister being.

                                Ptahankh, once a humble and
                                noble ruler of one of Egypt's greatest clans, was forever changed when a shadowed figure
                                offered him the forbidden power of a serum, known as <strong>Lunaris</strong>.

                                Tempted by the promise of power, he succumbed. Paranoia consumed him, driving him to
                                betray and murder his own kind, fearing they would take his newfound strength. When the
                                <strong>Blood Moon</strong> rose, he consumed it, becoming something beyond saving.

                        his rage unleashed devastation, nearly eradicating the human race. When the eclipse finally
