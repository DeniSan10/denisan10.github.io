                </div>
                <div class="intro-text">The story begins thousands of years ago, during the early days when the pyramids
                    were just starting to take shape. This was long after the Gods had created what they considered the
                    perfect reflection of themselves — humans — to populate the Earth and expand their divine vision.

                        <p>Humans began to populate the Earth, spreading their influence and establishing homes,
                            shelters, and territories. With their rise, however, came a heavy price, greed and
                            conflict. Wars erupted, and bloodshed became rampant, spreading chaos across the land faster
                            than anything else. The Gods eventually noticed the shift in human nature and decided to
                            witness it firsthand.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>This was the moment their greed was truly tested. The most powerful of all the Gods, Osiris,
                            descended to Earth and crafted a stone with his own blood, beautiful yet unsettling in
                            its eerie shine. This stone was far from ordinary; it held a liquid so obscure that its true
                            nature defied human understanding. After its creation, Osiris
                            commanded Khonsu, the God of the Moon, to spill his divine blood and infuse it
                            to the moon itself, binding its power to the stone.</p>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <p>This event was inscribed onto a cursed papyrus under
                            the name of Lunarium. Buried deep within the earth, it lay dormant, waiting for a worthy
                            clan to uncover its secrets.</p>

                    <p>In the depths of Cairo, there lay a kingdom known as the Osirian Ascendancy. This clan was led by
                        three powerful pharaohs who shared everything with everyone, earning them great respect. They
                        were renowned for their wisdom and compassion, having established peace throughout all of Egypt.
                        However, their harmony was disrupted when they met their eyes upon the
                        prophecy, offered to them by a mysterious man...

                            encountered the same mysterious man once more. This time, the figure made a sinister offer:
                            a stone whose described powers eerily mirrored the ancient scriptures' prophecies, in
                            exchange for his soul.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>He hesitated, but accepted the <strong>deal</strong>.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Making his way back to his palace, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was following
                            him at all times. He distanced himself from his peers and comrades,
                            paranoid that they would discover his secret. It was his alone. No one had to find out.</p>

                    <p>
                        Days had passed since he obtained the stone, and the Earth was consumed by darkness, drowning
                        the skies in a haunting crimson hue. Ptahankh murdered his comrades in cold blood and
                        consumed the serum he had crafted from the liquid.
                    </p>
                    <p>His body began to melt, his form disintegrating into a grotesque display of corruption.
                        Thunder clapped across the lands as his twisted transformation reached its peak. From within his
                        very being, dark energies burst forth, unleashing hordes of undead that rose from the boiling
                        sands, slaughtering all in their path. Weeks passed, and the curse seemed to
                        vanish without a trace, as if it had never existed—leaving the world to wonder if the darkness
                        had truly been lifted.</p>

                            horrific cost. Innocent civilians became their unwilling subjects, tortured relentlessly
                            until their final breath.</p>
                        <p>They established a clandestine society hidden deep within the shadows of the dark web with

                            mystery, but he followed them willingly, journeying all the way to Cairo on his own.</p>
                        <br>

                            littered with corpses—previous trespassers twisted in unnatural directions. Eerie
                            whispers echoed from the walls, some warning him to turn back, others begging him to press
                            forward. Was it all in his head?</p>

                        ancient corpse
                        lay brittle and fragmented, its body decayed. Driven by some dark purpose
