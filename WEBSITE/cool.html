            <p>Welcome to the about me page! Here’s your chance to learn a little something about me, the one who
                created this madness! I’m the brain (and chaos) behind it all, so if you’re curious about what’s
                going on in my world, you’ve come to the right place.</p>

                    <p>Boo, it's me, the one who made it all happen: the story, the art, the website, everything. I'm
                        just
                        your average university student, but with a not-so-average mind... call it creative mess. I’ve
                        got ideas that can’t be stopped, and a personality to match! </p>

                <p class="extra">Hey there, nice to meet you! I’m Denis Vaida, 20 years old (as of writing this), and
                    I’m based in the United Kingdom. I’m currently studying cyber security and web development, but I’m
                    not all
                    about tech. Back in 6th form, I was really into art, even though I didn’t quite vibe with the system
                    there. Now, I’m deep into programming, but I guess I still needed to release my creativity somehow,
                    so I ended up writing a book. And, of course, I made this website to promote it. Ain’t life full of
                    surprises?</p>

                        <p>Despite having a Romanian background, I actually grew up in Spain for most of my life. After
                            finishing primary school, I moved to England and have settled here ever since, which means
                            I’m quite the multicultural guy! This extensive background made me into a laid-back,
                            open-minded
                            fellow.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I won’t lie though, I’ve been into scary stuff since I was a kid, music included. I love
                            deep, intense feelings, whether it’s extreme horror or the heavy blast of metal. I’m
                            all about those strong vibes. And, of course, my favourite colour is red, if you didn’t
                            notice LOL.</p>

                    <p>It all started at the end of 2021, a really tough time in my life. In the span of just one month,
                        I lost two family members, which sent me into a serious depression. I needed a way to cope with
                        all the mental pain, so I decided to channel it into something aggressive, something to release
                        all those emotions. That’s when I started creating a horror project (check out the Artwork page
                        for
                        more details), and eventually, a few years later, it grew into what became Lunarium.</p>

                <p class="extra">I know the novel is still a long way from being finished. Between university,
                    work, and everything else, it’s been tough to find the time. Developing this site also took a lot
                    longer than I expected! But now that it’s done, I’m finally able to put my full focus into the
                    novel. I want it to be something that really resonates, packed with emotions that hit deep.
                    Once it’s ready and finished, I’ll make a big announcement and release it for everyone to enjoy!
                    You’ll be the first to know when it’s up for purchase!</p>

                        <p>I even took my time to sprinkle a bit of myself into the novel—because why not, right? If I
                            were a zombie and self-aware, I’d probably be that goofy one, totally oblivious to the
                            seriousness of the situation, just scaring humans without actually hurting them. That’s
                            Cadaver-7's doing, not mine. (check the cast to learn about him)</p>
                        <p>I'd probably get only three minutes of screen time before dying a tragic
                            death while taking a selfie—one that shocks everyone, haha.</p>

                        <p>For now, that's all I have to say about myself. Hopefully, I left a good impression! If
                            not, well, sorry, not sorry. That's just me!</p>
                        <p>Regardless, I hope you enjoy exploring the website and learning about my project. If you'd
